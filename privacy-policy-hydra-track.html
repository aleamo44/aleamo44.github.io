        <h4>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h4>

        <h4>Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)</h4>

        </ul>
        <p>This data is <span class="highlight">anonymous</span> and is used exclusively to identify and fix technical issues, improving the App's stability. The data is handled according to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
