  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: September 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Call Blocker Community (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spam Reports</strong>: Phone numbers you report as spam and the category you assign (e.g., “Telemarketing,” “Fraud”).</li>
    <li><strong>Problem Reports</strong>: If you submit a support request, we collect your email address and issue description to contact you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymous User ID</strong>: Generated via Firebase Authentication (anonymous sign-in) to associate reports and logs without requiring personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Call and Contact Information (with permission)</strong>: The App needs access to your call history (numbers, dates, times) and checks numbers against your contacts to avoid blocking them. Your contact list is never uploaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong>: Collected via Google AdMob (advertising ID and technical information) for personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Information</strong>: Your IP address and network status may be collected by Firebase and AdMob.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>C. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
  <p>We do not collect your name, address book, geographic location, or any other sensitive personal data.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. How Data Is Used and Stored</h2>
  <p>Data is used to identify and block spam, improve our service, support ads, and respond to support requests.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stored locally: cache, whitelist, settings.</li>
    <li>Stored securely on Firebase Firestore servers: spam database, your reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard safeguards, including HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit, and rely on Google’s secure cloud infrastructure.</p>
